# Module-1-Challenge
In this challenge we are to take the existing code and doing the following:

    1. Add semantics to the HTML elements so that we (as developers) have the page layed out in a simple way thats easy to understand and follow.
        a) This was done by adding in section/nav/benefits sections to make it easier to identify code
    2. The elements are logically layed out within the code (without using styling/positioning)
        a> This was achieved by reorganizing the CSS code to flow from top to bottom in a similar pattern to the HTML code
    3. Add alt attributes to any images to assist with visually impared users providing a description of the images
    4. Order the headings to be in sequential order 
    5. Update the title to be descriptive and under 60 characters as most browsers will not read beyond that
