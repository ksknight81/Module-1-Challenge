# Module-1-Challenge
In this challenge we are to take the existing code and doing the following:

    1. Add semantics to the HTML elements so that we (as developers) have the page layed out in a simple way thats easy to understand and follow.
    2. The elements are logically layed out within the code (without using styling/positioning)
    3. Add alt attributes to any images to assist with visually impared users providing a description of the images
    4. Order the headings to be in sequential order 
    5. Update the title to be consise/descriptive and under 60 characters as most browsers will not read beyond that
